If you are taking this class, you already have a solid grasp of 'pen and paper' physics. Modern physics, however, often requires tools beyond 'pen and paper' in two ways:
1. Large data sets that can require sophisticated processing and analysis.  
2. Intractable calculations, for example nonlinear systems or high-dimensional phase spaces.  

This is a crash course in learning to deal with data in physical systems and numerical solutions of problems using computers. This is neither a computer science course on algorithms nor a data-based lab course, but it is somewhere in between.
